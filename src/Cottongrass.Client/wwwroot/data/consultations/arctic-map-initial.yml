      ## Core Principles of Systematic Mapping
      
      Systematic mapping is an objective method to characterise the evidence base of a broad topic and identify evidence gaps, while reducing any potential biases. The process is focused on mapping the literature, and the resultant map is not necessarily a geographic map. Metadata about sources is extracted and the methods used often assessed for rigour. A related approach is systematic review, which is usually focused on a less-broad key question but involves the compilation and analysis of the underlying data to address the research question in a data synthesis. Systematic mapping is a hypothesis-generating approach, which can feed into later systematic reviews (which address the hypotheses); there is therefore scope for this after the map. A key consideration is development and publication of a systematic mapping protocol, which is a separate peer-reviewed publication that is completed before work commences on searches and data extraction (for a second peer-reviewed publication of the final map). For more information on the methods used within systematic mapping, Neil Haddaway from the Stockholm Environment Institute has produced good introductory resources for evidence synthesis techniques at: [https://systematicmappingmethods.github.io/intro.html](https://systematicmappingmethods.github.io/intro.html).

            Our main research question is 'what evidence exists for temporal variability 
            in the measures of Arctic terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity throughout the Holocene?'.
            Does this question broadly include your interest in long-term changes in Arctic biodiversity?

            Within the research question, we used a number of specific terms. We have 
            further defined these terms to make sure that we can clearly define the areas of study
            that will be included or excluded from our project.

            We need to clearly define the boundaries of the Arctic region. There are many possible
            ways of doing this. Which of the following would best define the Arctic when looking
            at changes in biodiversity over the last ten thousand years?

            Our study is focused on the 'Holocene' - the recent period of climatic stability 
            that has occurred since the last ice age to the present day. Although glaciers retreated
            at different times around the Arctic circle, we consider that it is since 11,500 
            years before the present day that the warmer conditions occurred in most regions marking
            the beginning of the Holocene. Do you agree with this definition?

      Translation: Search Strategy
    Description:
    - Language: en
      Translation: >
        The 'search strategy' that we use within the systematic map is the formal
        method through which we identify all relevant sources of information. The most
        important part of this is the 'search string', within which we list topics and
        their synonyms that indicate that a source is relevant to us. We aim to identify
        as much relevant material as possible, while avoiding finding sources that are not
        actually relevant. We have designed the search strings using thesauri and a test list
        of known relevant sources. 

        The search string:
        - is defined in many languages
        - is defined in multiple parts, all of which must be present in the source
        - includes wildcards to detect optional letters (?) and words with multiple endings (*).
        - requires that all parts are present for a source to be identified.
        - is tailored to each specific database source.

      Translation:
        A key part of the systematic mapping process is to identify all potential sources 
        of information, whether published (for example in peer-reviewed scientific journals, 
        Government or industry reports) or unpublished.

        We will not publish any unpublished datasets without express written permission. 
        The aim of this project is to identify the existence of data to understand the geographical and
        methodological needs for further research.

            Do you personally hold or have access to unpublished datasets (that relate to past 
            Arctic biodiversity)? These could for example include places where fossils were 
            found, archaeological sites, pollen counts from lake or peat sediment cores, or other proxy records.
