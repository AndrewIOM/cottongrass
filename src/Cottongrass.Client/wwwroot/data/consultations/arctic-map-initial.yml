      ## What are we consulting on?

      To understand past changes in Arctic biodiversity, we are compiling a *systematic map* of the
      current evidence. A systematic map provides a complete and unbiased synthesis of the state of
      knowledge on a particular topic. The process involves looking into library collections, looking
      for unpublished research, and technical reports to find all relevant scientific work.


      This research is a large undertaking, and we want to make sure that it has the most relevance
      to the most people, groups, and organisations.


      There are many ways in which your input is important: from defining the boundaries (such as the
      included taxonomic groups, places, and times), contributing to the study design, to identifying
      possible sources of new information. 

      ### Core Principles of Systematic Mapping
      
      Systematic mapping is an objective method to characterise the evidence base of a broad topic 
      and identify evidence gaps, while reducing any potential biases. The process is focused on 
      mapping the literature, and the resultant map is not necessarily a geographic map. 
      Metadata about sources is extracted and the methods used often assessed for rigour. 
      A related approach is systematic review, which is usually focused on a less-broad key 
      question but involves the compilation and analysis of the underlying data to address 
      the research question in a data synthesis. Systematic mapping is a hypothesis-generating 
      approach, which can feed into later systematic reviews (which address the hypotheses); 
      there is therefore scope for this after the map. A key consideration is development and 
      publication of a systematic mapping protocol, which is a separate peer-reviewed 
      publication that is completed before work commences on searches and data extraction 
      (for a second peer-reviewed publication of the final map). 
      For more information on the methods used within systematic mapping, Neil Haddaway 
      from the Stockholm Environment Institute has produced good introductory resources 
      for evidence synthesis techniques at:

    # Section 1. Research Scope (including definitions, primary research question)
  - Section:

        From this point on, you can skip any questions that you do not wish to answer.

        
        In this section, we would like to know whether the current **scope** of the research
        suits your interests in Arctic biodiversity. The **scope** defines which study areas will
        be included and excluded from our systematic map. 


        We have defined a **primary research question**, which states the scientific problem
        that our map will address. Within the research question, some key terms require
        defining and 'scoping':


          * the Arctic region (where to set the geographical limits?)
          * Holocene *or* long-term (what are the start and end dates?)
          * Arctic biota (what groups and species to include?)
          * Measures of biodiversity (what measures exist?)


        For each term, we need to decide the limits within which the systematic map will be
        most useful to the widest audience, but also practical to complete.

      Translation: Search Strategy
    Description:
    - Language: en
      Translation: >
        The 'search strategy' is the formal method through which we identify all 
        relevant sources of information relating to past changes in
        Arctic biodiversity. The important considerations are:
        
        1. Identifying the core **search concepts** that can indicate a document or source contains
           information relevant to us.

        2. Deciding the databases and archives to look within.

        3. Finding out who has access to unpublished work that may be relevant, and if it
           can be shared with us. We call this 'grey literature'.

        To best identify and structure our search concepts, we took the research question
        and looked for the connections between the parts. A common method used in systematic
        maps is to identify the **Population** (what is under study?), **Exposure** (what is it 
        subject to?), **Comparator** (what are the different levels of exposure?), and 
        **Outcome** (what are the responses?). We can then identify studies where all 
        of these components are present. Please take a look at the diagram below, following 
        the arrows from the top-left corner:


        ![The theory of change used in this study](images/peco-simple.png)


        Here, our **population** (Arctic biota) are **exposed** to the movement of time,
        resulting in changes to the **outcomes** (measures of biodiversity, such as the
        diversity and distribution of species).


        Looking into the past is not straightforward, as we never observe changes as they
        happen. Rather, we see traces of animals, plants, and other biota (or 'proxies').
        Examples of proxies include: pollen or spores; ancient DNA fragments; 
        fossil insects or plant parts; or bones and tusks.

    Description:
    - Language: en
      Translation: >
        The most important part of the **search strategy** is the 'search string'. The string is made up of concepts - and
        terms / synonyms that relate to them - to indicate that a source is relevant to our research question. The concepts should identify
        as much relevant material as possible, while avoiding finding sources that are not
        actually relevant (false positives). We have determined a list of concepts and terms by using thesauri and a test list
        of known relevant sources. 


        The search string:

        * requires that the **Population** (Arctic biota), **Exposure** (movement of time over decades to centuries), and **Outcomes** (measures of biodiversity) are all present

        * is defined in many languages

        * is tailored to each specific database source.

        * includes wildcards to detect optional letters (?) and words with multiple endings (*).


        We would like to ask you whether you think we have included all of the concepts that
        are important for each of the Population, Exposure, and Outcome in the following sections.


        First, we would like to ask you about **Arctic biota**, our Population.

        To ensure that we only include information relevant to Arctic biota, we
        have chosen to limit studies to those that contain an Arctic-specific concept. 
        
        
        We have currently included the following concepts:

        Next, we would like to ask you about how we identify 'the movement of time', our Exposure.


        We are only interested in long-term (100s or 1000s of years) dynamics. The concepts here therefore reflect
        those that indicate that a study includes long-term dynamics. For example, the concepts below include methods
        (like dating methods), and fields of study (like palaeoecology) that indicate the analysis of something from the past.
        

        We have included the following concepts:

          | Concept                      | Terms within concept                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

            on the region of the world and the context of the research. Are there any sets of these labels
            that you can see we are missing? If so, please tell us below.

    Description:
    - Language: en
      Translation: >
        Next, we would like to ask you about how we identify that a study includes 'measures of
        biodiversity', our Outcome.
        

        By 'measures of biodiversity', we mean measures, metrics, and statistics that quantify
        how biodiversity may change through time. Examples include presence-absence, abundance, and diversity.
        Some terms, such as 'palaeocommunities', are specific to the study of the past.

        
        We have included the following concepts:

          | Concept                              | Terms within concept                                                                                     |

      Translation: Search Concepts - Biotic Proxies used for Environmental Reconstruction
    Description:
    - Language: en
      Translation: >        
        Looking into the past is not straightforward, as we never observe changes as they
        happen. Rather, we see traces of animals, plants, and other biota (or **biotic proxies**).
        Examples of these include: pollen or spores; ancient DNA fragments; 
        fossil insects or plant parts; or bones and tusks. These proxies cause two additional
        problems that we need to look at seperately, which are described below.

        ### Problem 1. Links between fossils and biota

        Scientific papers sometimes discuss changes in **biotic proxies** through time, 
        but do not link these to particular plants, animals, or other species. As these sources
        may be important sources of additional information, we included additional concepts within
        the 'Population' to identify them:
        

          | Concept                   | Terms within concept                                                                                                                                                                                    |
          | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
          | Palynology etc.           | ("pollen" OR "palynology" OR "macrofossil" OR "pal?eobotanical" OR "leaf wax" OR "palynomorph") OR                                                                                                      |
          | Individual biotic proxies | ("diatom" OR "chironomid" OR "insect" OR "ostracod" OR "ostracode" OR "macroinvertebrate" OR "macro-invertebrate" OR "testate amoeba" OR "organic biomarker" OR "sporomiella" OR "dung fungal pore") OR |
          | Dendro proxies            | ("ring width" OR "wood ring" OR "tree ring" OR "stem sample" OR "driftwood") OR                                                                                                                         |
          | General terms             | ("terrestrial proxies" OR "terrestrial proxy")                                                                                                                                                          |    

        ### Problem 2. Other reconstructions
        
        Sometimes, scientific papers contain relevant information on the long-term temporal 
        dynamics of Arctic biodiversity, but their research questions are not interested in
        changes in biodiversity. In these cases, they may use the data to reconstruct 
        environmental change through time, such as summer air temperatures or winter precipitation. 
        We want to capture these papers as important sources of additional information, 
        so we have included additional concepts relating to these reconstructions in our Outcomes:
        

          | Concept                                    | Terms within concept                                                                                                         |
          | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

          | Precipitation and Hydrology                | ("hydroclimate" OR "precipitation") OR                                                                                       |
          | Past climates                              | ("pal?eoclimat\*" OR "past climate" OR "climate of the past") OR                                                             |
          | Lake levels                                | ("lake level") OR                                                                                                            |
          | Vegetation productivity                    | ("vegetation productivity" OR "plant productivity" OR "radial growth" OR "annual growth" OR "growth rate" OR "fuel load") OR |
          | Climate (general)                          | ("climate variable" OR "climate interpretation" OR "proxy climate record") OR                                                |
          | Snow patterns                              | ("snow cover" OR "snow extent") OR                                                                                           |
          | Carbon storage                             | ("organic carbon release" OR "permafrost carbon" OR "soil carbon release") OR                                                |
