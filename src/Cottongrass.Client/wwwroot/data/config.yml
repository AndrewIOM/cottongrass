      ## Overview

      ### Philosophy

      Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.

      Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted
      document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking
      like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While
      Markdown's syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML
      filters -- including [Setext](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/mirror/setext.html), [atx](http://www.aaronsw.com/2002/atx/), [Textile](http://textism.com/tools/textile/), [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html),
      [Grutatext](http://www.triptico.com/software/grutatxt.html), and [EtText](http://ettext.taint.org/doc/) -- the single biggest source of
      inspiration for Markdown's syntax is the format of plain text email.

      ### Paragraphs and Line Breaks

      A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated
      by one or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a
      blank line -- a line containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered
      blank.) Normal paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.

      The implication of the "one or more consecutive lines of text" rule is
      that Markdown supports "hard-wrapped" text paragraphs. This differs
      significantly from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable
      Type's "Convert Line Breaks" option) which translate every line break
      character in a paragraph into a `<br />` tag.
