      ## What is the research?

      Climate change is driving rapid warming of the Arctic region, with impacts on Arctic plants, 
      animals, and other species. To better understand how life in the Arctic may respond to these changes - 
      and what can be done to protect it - we can look to the past. Rates of change in the diversity 
      and distribution of *biodiversity* within the last ten thousand years can be used to inform
      our current models and projections of how biodiversity will be affected in the 21st century.
      

      To understand past changes in Arctic biodiversity, we are compiling a *systematic map* of the
      current evidence. A systematic map provides a complete and unbiased synthesis of the state of
      knowledge on a particular topic. The process involves looking into library collections, looking
      for unpublished research, and technical reports to find all relevant scientific work.

      ## How do researchers understand past changes in Arctic biodiversity over thousands of years?

      Plants, animals, fungi, and others can leave behind traces that they existed in the environment.
      Examples include bones, tiny microscopic fossils (such as plant pollen), pine cones, leaves, 
      and seeds, and mammoth tusks. They are often left behind in 'environmental archives' 
      like lake sediments, peat, and frozen ground. 
      The remains can be dated using radio-carbon and other dating methods, giving us an idea of 
      what species existed, when, and their numbers.

      ## Working together to a common goal - we need your help

      This project is a wide collaboration across languages and with all those that have an 
      interest in Arctic biodiversity.
      There are many ways in which your input is important: from defining the boundaries (such as the
      included taxonomic groups, places, and times), contributing to the study design, to identifying
      possible sources of new information. 


      We are especially interested to work with those who call the Arctic their home, 
      academic researchers, Government organisations, Arctic land managers, museums and interpretation
      centres, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) with an interest in Arctic environments.
      All are welcome to work with us.

      ## Who are the review team and how are they funded?

      The review team (who search for and compile the evidence) are an international group
      of academic researchers from the Finland, Russia, Sweden, the UK, Iceland, and Denmark. 
      
      The research is being funded by the European Commission through a Horizon 2020 collaboration.
      The collaboration is called CHARTER - 'Changes in Arctic Terrestrial Biodiversity'. You can find
      more information on the [CHARTER website](https://charter-arctic.org).
